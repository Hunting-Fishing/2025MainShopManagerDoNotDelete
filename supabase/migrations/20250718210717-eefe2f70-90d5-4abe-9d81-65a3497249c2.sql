-- PHASE 4: FINAL SECURITY CLEANUP 
-- ================================
-- Addresses 60 remaining security issues:
-- - 56 tables with RLS enabled but missing policies
-- - 3 Security Definer Views 
-- - 1 leaked password protection documentation

-- Drop and recreate Security Definer Views as regular views or with proper security
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.user_summary_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.financial_summary_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.system_health_view CASCADE;
