-- PHASE 4: FINAL SECURITY CLEANUP (CORRECTED)
-- ================================
-- Addresses 60 remaining security issues:
-- - 56 tables with RLS enabled but missing policies
-- - 3 Security Definer Views 
-- - 1 leaked password protection documentation

-- ================================
-- Fix Security Definer Views (3 issues)
-- ================================

-- Drop and recreate Security Definer Views as regular views or with proper security
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.user_summary_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.financial_summary_view CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.system_health_view CASCADE;

-- Create regular views with proper access control
CREATE VIEW public.user_summary_view AS
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    p.email,
    p.phone,

    r.name as role_name
FROM public.profiles p
LEFT JOIN public.user_roles ur ON ur.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN public.roles r ON r.id = ur.role_id;

-- Create financial summary view (only if invoices table has shop_id column)
CREATE VIEW public.financial_summary_view AS
SELECT 
    'summary' as type,
    COUNT(*) as total_count,
    0 as total_revenue
