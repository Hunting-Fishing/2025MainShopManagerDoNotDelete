// Centralized settings services export
// Only export services that actually exist to avoid build errors

// Note: Add these exports when the actual service files are created:
// export { companyService } from './companyService';
// export { businessHoursService } from './businessHoursService';
// export { businessIndustryService } from './businessIndustryService';
// export { appearanceService } from './appearanceService';
// export { securityService } from './securityService';
// export { emailProviderService } from './emailProviderService';
// export { integrationService } from './integrationService';

// Re-export types for convenience when services are implemented
// export type { CompanyInfo, BusinessHours } from './companyService';

// Placeholder for future service implementations
export const settingsServices = {
  // Services will be added here as they are implemented
};
